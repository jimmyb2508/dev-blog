My journey to becoming a software developer

I have created this blog to document my journey towards becoming a profesionnal software developer. 

The 25th August is my birthday but it is also the day I began to code, here in the year 2019, at the age of 34. 

### Codecademy

To begin, I signed up to codecademy and began to work through the series of courses to develop my unserstanding of code.

### Manchester Codes

Next I got in touch with coding Bootcamp providers 'Manchester Codes' to get some command line training. 

### Code Up

Then I attended regular classes at Code Up meetings, mainly in Stockport, Cheshire.
